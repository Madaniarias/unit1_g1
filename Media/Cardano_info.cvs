Cardano is one of the biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap.
It’s designed to be a flexible, sustainable, and scalable blockchain platform for running smart contracts
— which will allow the development of a wide range of decentralized finance apps, new crypto tokens, games, and more.
Cardano’s goal is to be the most environmentally sustainable blockchain platform.
It uses a unique proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called Ouroboros, as opposed to the energy-intensive
proof-of-work system currently used by Bitcoin and Ethereum.
Cardano was launched in September 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson.
The values of Cardano as of Sunday, October 2 is around 62.33 Japanese yen.
